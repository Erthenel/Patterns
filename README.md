Examples of programming patterns.

Some of them are based on Eric & Elisabeth Freeman's book "Head First - Design Patterns".

# OO Basics
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

# OO Principles
1. Encapsulate what varies.
2. Favor composition over inheritence.
3. Program to interfaces, not implementations.
4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

# OO Patterns
1. Strategy - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
2. Observer - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
