Examples of programming patterns.

Some of them are based on Eric & Elisabeth Freeman's book "Head First - Design Patterns".

# OO Basics
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

# OO Principles
1. Encapsulate what varies.
2. Favor composition over inheritance.
3. Program to interfaces, not implementations.
4. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
5. Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
6. Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

# OO Patterns
1. Strategy - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
2. Observer - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
3. Decorator - attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
4. Factory Method - defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
5. Abstract Factory - provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
